      <div>
        with SPA , once I refresh any the route page url (Not index main page url), I get a page not found error. <br />
        This is because when we access any route on our local machine, React Router handles the routing. <br />
        But when we deploy the application on any server, directly accessing the route will send the request to the server itself (Netlify in our
        case).

          Create a new file with the name <SpanBlue>_redirects</SpanBlue>
        </li>
        <li className="my-1">
          Place the file under <SpanBlue>public</SpanBlue> folder of the project
        </li>
        <li className="my-1">
          add the following contents inside it <SpanBlue>/* /index.html 200</SpanBlue>
        </li>
        <li className="my-1">
          Here, we're telling Netlify to redirect all the routes to the <SpanBlue>index.html</SpanBlue> file.
        </li>
        <li className="my-1">
          The <SpanBlue>index.html</SpanBlue> file contains our entire React app code
        </li>
        <li className="my-1">
          And as routing is handled by our React app which is contained in the index.html file, our application will work without a page not found
          issue.
